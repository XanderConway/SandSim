# SandSim

A falling sand simulator that runs in unity, based loosely on the GDC talk from Nolla games

The number keys can be used to switch between different materials, and 'A' can be used to generate colliders using a marching squares algorithm.
Currently a work in progress.

**If you're interested in projects like this, I also published a sand castle building game that simulates moisture.**
